Hi! This is my final project, "Dragon's Slayer" a text-based choose-your-own-adventure game, where the user takes on the role of a knight hwo has been tasked with delving into the dragon's cave in search of its lair, in hopes of slaying the mighty beast.
The game presents the player with the prompt, followed by two or more words in caps, these words are the choices the player has to perform actions within the game. Either the player picks one of these choices, restarts the game by typing "restart" or the game will present the player with a message saying their attempt was invalid.
Additionally there is a simple combat system where the player can either type "attack" or "defend", which has their respective effects in game.
At the end of the game, the player is presented with "The End", signifying their finding of one of the many endings the game has to offer!
